<p>
    The Scomodo Interactive Maps project is a digital mapping initiative
    developed for the cultural association Scomodo, focused on visualizing and
    analyzing aggregation spaces, social struggle locations, and study
    environments across Bari, Italy. Created as part of a collective research
    article examining urban spaces and youth accessibility, this project
    combines data processing, geospatial analysis, and interactive web
    visualization to document the social infrastructure available to young
    people in the city.
</p>

<p>
    The Scomodo association has long been concerned with the availability and
    accessibility of physical spaces for youth, making this mapping project a
    natural extension of their mission. The interactive platform serves multiple
    purposes: documenting existing aggregation spaces, collecting
    community-reported locations through questionnaires, integrating
    OpenStreetMap data for comprehensive urban amenity mapping, and providing an
    accessible tool for citizens to explore available spaces in their city.
</p>

<p>
    The project consists of three distinct interactive map applications, each
    designed with specific use cases in mind, alongside a robust data processing
    pipeline that transforms raw geographic data into usable JSON datasets. The
    mock version of the pages you find the link to in the sidebar is hosted on
    Cloudflare Pages.

<h2>What I Worked On</h2>
<p>
    Throughout this project, I was responsible for the complete development
    lifecycle from data transformation to deployment. I designed and implemented
    the data processing pipeline using Python and Jupyter notebooks, creating
    automated scripts to transform raw Excel data into structured JSON datasets
    and integrate OpenStreetMap data through the
    <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API"> Overpass API</a
    >. I developed three distinct interactive web mapping applications using
    JavaScript, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/"> Leaflet.js </a>, and modern
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp">ES6</a>
    modules, each with unique interaction patterns for specific use cases:
    multi-layer visualization with heat maps, spotlight-based focused
    exploration, and time-based filtering for opening hours of study facilities.
</p>

<p>
    I implemented geospatial analysis features including coordinate validation,
    distance calculations for proximity filtering, and polygon boundary overlays
    for neighborhood visualization. The front-end development involved creating
    responsive user interfaces with custom SVG overlays for the spotlight
    effect, interactive time selection controls, and detailed information panels
    with structured data display. I also integrated form handling with the
    <a href="https://web3forms.com/">Web3Forms</a>
    API for community submissions, implementing client-side validation and error
    handling to ensure data quality.
</p>

<p>
    The deployment process involved configuring the project for hosting on
    <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"> Cloudflare Pages </a>, optimizing
    asset delivery. Throughout the project, I collaborated with the Scomodo
    association to understand their research needs and translate them into
    functional technical requirements, resulting in a suite of tools that
    support their mission of documenting and analyzing urban spaces for youth
    accessibility in Bari.

<h2>Data Analysis Notebooks</h2>

<h3>Notebook: Geographic Data Transformation Pipeline</h3>
<p>
    The first
    <a
        href="https://scomodo-interactive-maps.pages.dev/notebooks/mappaturaExcelToJson"
    >
        notebook
    </a>
    automates the transformation of geographic and other data from Excel
    spreadsheets into structured JSON datasets. This data processing tool
    extracts hyperlinks, parses opening hours with multiple time slots per day,
    and organizes spaces by category including aggregation spaces, social
    struggle locations, and study environments. The notebook ensures data
    consistency and prepares the information for integration with the
    interactive mapping visualizations.
</p>

<h3>Notebook: OpenStreetMap POI Extraction</h3>
<p>
    The second
    <a href="https://scomodo-interactive-maps.pages.dev/notebooks/query">
        notebook
    </a>
    queries OpenStreetMap's Overpass API to collect Points of Interest (POIs)
    and amenities across Bari. Using geometric operations to validate
    coordinates for the spatial database, this notebook automatically retrieves
    comprehensive urban infrastructure data including cafes, libraries, parks,
    and other public spaces. The collected data is processed and formatted into
    ready-to-use JSON files that complement the manually collected space
    information.

<h2>Aggregation Spaces Map</h2>

<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
    An interactive multi-layer mapping platform for
    <a href="https://scomodo-interactive-maps.pages.dev/SpaziAggregazioneMap/">
        visualizing aggregation spaces </a
    >, citizen-reported locations from questionnaires, and OpenStreetMap
    amenities across Bari. The visualization is structured with a modular
    architecture with three independently controllable data layers, each
    toggleable between pin markers and heat density visualization modes. Users
    can switch visualization modes through radio controls, explore individual
    locations with detailed tooltips showing names, addresses, and categories,
    and access comprehensive information including structured opening hours and
    coordinates in a slide-out side panel. Built with Leaflet.js and organized
    with ES6 modules, the platform includes UI hiding functionality for
    distraction-free exploration, custom color-coded markers for different space
    types, polygon boundary overlays showing Bari's outline, and responsive
    design optimized for analyzing spatial distribution patterns of social
    spaces throughout the city.
</p>

<h2>Social Struggle Spaces Map</h2>
<img src="spaziDiLotta.png" alt="Social Struggle Spaces Map" />
<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
    A interactive mapping application focused on
    <a
        href="https://scomodo-interactive-maps.pages.dev/SpaziDiLottaInteractive/"
    >
        visualizing social struggle spaces in Bari
    </a>
    through a unique spotlight interaction pattern. When clicking any location
    pin, the system generates a SVG overlay that darkens the entire map while
    creating a 150-meter radius circular cutout around the selected point,
    visually "spotlighting" that area and filtering nearby OpenStreetMap
    amenities within the illuminated zone. The visualization features a
    dual-layer architecture displaying social struggle spaces as primary markers
    alongside secondary OpenStreetMap amenities with distance-based visibility
    filtering. A special "All places" mode simultaneously highlights all
    locations with multiple circular cutouts, allowing users to see the
    collective spatial impact of social struggle spaces across the city. Built
    with Leaflet.js and modular ES6 architecture, the interface emphasizes
    focused exploration over complex controls with a single-button toggle,
    creating a clean and distraction-free spatial analysis experience.

<h2>Study Spaces Map</h2>
<img src="spaziDiStudio.png" alt="Study Spaces Map" />
<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
    A
    <a href="https://scomodo-interactive-maps.pages.dev/SpaziStudioMap/">
        time-interactive mapping platform designed for discovering study spaces
        across Bari
    </a>
    with intelligent availability filtering based on opening hours. The
    visualization features a horizontal time control interface allowing users to
    select any day of the week and hour of the day to automatically filter
    locations by their opening hours, with the system defaulting to the current
    time and "show only open" spaces mode on page load. The comprehensive
    opening hours parsing and display system shows structured weekly schedules
    with multiple time slots per day, making it easy for students to find
    available study locations at any given moment. The platform includes a
    validated web form where users can contribute new study space locations by
    submitting information such as name, email, description, address,
    functionality, capacity, and relevant links. Form submissions are processed
    directly via the Web3Forms API with real-time field validation and error
    handling, enabling community-driven content expansion. Built specifically
    for students seeking available study locations, the visualization combines
    Leaflet.js mapping technology with practical scheduling utilities and an
    accessible submission workflow.
