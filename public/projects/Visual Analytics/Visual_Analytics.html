    This project addresses the
    <strong>VAST Challenge 2023 Mini-Challenge 1</strong>, focused on combating
    <strong>illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing</strong>.
    <em>FishEye International</em>, an organization dedicated to protecting
    marine species, gathers online news articles about fishing and the marine
    industry. Using <em>natural language processing</em>, they extract entities
    and relationships to create a <strong>knowledge graph</strong> for
    investigating suspicious activities.
</p>

<p>
    The challenge was to develop an
    <strong>interactive visual analytics tool</strong> that helps analysts
    explore contextual information around suspected entities without being
    overwhelmed by data. The tool needed to be
    <strong>dynamic and interactive</strong>, emphasizing relevant connections
    to identify companies potentially engaged in illegal fishing.
</p>

<p>
    Four specific entities were designated for investigation:
    <em>Mar de la Vida OJSC</em>, <em>979893388</em>,
    <em>Oceanfront Oasis Inc Carrie</em>, and <em>8327</em>. The visualization
    was built using <strong>JavaScript and D3.js</strong> to create an
    interactive network graph with multiple exploration features, allowing
    analysts to discover patterns and relationships that might indicate illegal
    fishing activities.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<p>
    This project marked my
    <strong>first experience with the D3.js library</strong>, which revealed
    very helpful for my
    <a href="http://localhost:5173/projects/master-thesis"
        >Master Thesis's project</a
    >. The reliance solely on JavaScript for data manipulation
    <strong>limited options</strong> and made the process less efficient
    compared to using a <em>dedicated API</em> as i was used while
    <a href="https://alessandrocarella.pages.dev/resume">working</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The most challenging aspect was the
    <strong>initial data exploration phase</strong>. Without a clear pattern
    identified beforehand, the project evolved into building a comprehensive
    <strong>"toolbox" for visual data exploration</strong>. This approach taught
    me that effective visual analytics can emerge through
    <em>iterative development</em> and user interaction rather than being
    limited to predetermined analysis.
</p>

<p>
    Through visual exploration, I learned to identify
    <strong>key patterns indicating potential illegal activity</strong>: highly
    interconnected clusters of entities and nodes with numerous incoming and
    outgoing connections. The entity
    <strong>979893388 emerged as a central node</strong> connected to multiple
    clusters, particularly through <em>partnership links</em>, revealing a
    network of major entities including <em>Mar del Oeste Pic</em>,
    <em>Ocean Fisheries Llc</em>, and <em>SeaSpray Wave SRL Solutions</em>.

<p>
    Selecting an appropriate <strong>color palette</strong> was crucial for
    intuitive navigation. Using
    <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set3&n=9">
        <em>ColorBrewer</em>
    </a>
    's qualitative scheme with <strong>nine distinct colors</strong>, I learned
    to balance visual clarity with information density. Colors distinguished
    between <em>node states</em> (entity to investigate, clickable nodes,
    sources, targets) and <em>link types</em>
    (ownership, partnership, family relationship, membership).
</p>

<p>
    Implementing <strong>multiple interaction methods</strong> taught me about
    <em>progressive disclosure</em> in UI design. The left panel provides
    filtered views and distance-based exploration, left-clicking highlights
    immediate connections, right-clicking expands nodes to reveal sources or
    targets, and hovering displays detailed tooltips. Each interaction serves a
    specific analytical purpose without overwhelming users.
</p>

<p>
    Creating the <strong>"link distance n" concept</strong> (you can read about
    it in the report) allowed for systematic network traversal, defining
    distance as the number of links needed to reach other nodes from an origin.
</p>

<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>

<p>
    The VAST Challenge provided data in <strong>JSON format</strong> containing
    nodes with attributes (<em>type, country, id</em>) and links with attributes
    (<em>type, weight, source, target</em>).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Data cleaning</strong> involved removing nodes with no connections
    not appearing in the edges dataset, handling
    <strong>1,815 nodes missing type attributes</strong>, and addressing
    <strong>6,948 nodes missing country information</strong>. For duplicate IDs,
    the strategy prioritized retaining
    <strong>less frequent entity types</strong>. For example, when ID 18
    appeared as both "organization" (987 instances) and "vessel" (115
    instances), the less common "vessel" type was retained.
</p>

<p>
    Two CSV files were created, <em>nodes.csv</em> and <em>edges.csv</em>, then
    merged to produce a dataset with columns for link type, weight, source,
    target, and attributes for both source and target nodes. Missing values were
    replaced with "Unknown" to maintain dataset integrity while enabling proper
    visualization.
</p>

<p>
    The core visualization uses
    <a href="https://d3js.org/d3-force">
        <strong>D3.js force-directed graphs</strong>
    </a>
    to create an interactive network. <strong>Node sizes vary</strong> based on
    the number of incoming and outgoing connections, providing visual indicators
    of entity importance.
    <strong>Link widths correspond to connection weights</strong>, with thicker
    lines representing stronger relationships. For bidirectional links, width is
    determined by the highest weight between directions.
</p>

<p>
    To handle <strong>multiple link types between two nodes</strong>, links are
    drawn at different angles ensuring simultaneous visibility of all
    connections. This required custom calculations based on link type presence.
    A <em>dummy link</em> with lower simulation strength connects the four
    entities under investigation, maintaining their grouping without interfering
    with navigation.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>left panel serves as the primary control interface</strong>. The
    "Investigate Number of Links Distance" section includes a dropdown to select
    entities and three numeric inputs to explore nodes at distance n, viewing
    them as sources, targets, or both. These inputs operate independently,
    resetting others when activated to streamline user interaction.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Four buttons allow filtering by link type</strong> (ownership,
    partnership, family relationship, membership). Clicking a button disables
    that link type and turns the button gray, with subsequent clicks re-enabling
    the links. An <strong>opacity slider</strong> controls the visibility of
    non-highlighted nodes and links, ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments,
    with a default of 10%.
</p>

<div class="two-images-div">

    />
    <img
        src="Link types buttons.png"
        alt="Filter by link type"
    />
</div>

<p>
    Two select menus at the panel bottom enable
    <strong>specific node investigation</strong>, allowing users to view a
    selected node with its targets or sources. This targeted exploration
    complements the broader distance-based analysis.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Left-clicking a node highlights it</strong> along with all
    connections at link distance 1, reducing opacity for other elements.
    Double-clicking the same node returns to the default view. This interaction
    replaced an earlier implementation using red borders, as the
    <em>opacity-based approach</em> proved more effective.
</p>

    />
    <img
        src="node highlight example.png"
        alt="Node highlight example"
    />
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Right-clicking opens a context menu</strong> with options to expand
    the node as a source (revealing targets), as a target (revealing sources),
    or both. Hovering over nodes displays <strong>tooltips</strong> showing the
    node name, type, country, number of sources, and number of targets. This
    information helps users make informed decisions before expanding nodes.
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>"Show Map Legend" button</strong> in the top-right corner reveals
    a right panel explaining colors, symbols, interaction methods, and links
    between investigated entities. The button text changes to "Hide Map Legend"
    when the panel is visible.

</div>

<h2>Design Decisions</h2>

<p>
    After testing various color palettes, a
    <strong>qualitative color scheme from ColorBrewer</strong> with nine
    distinct colors was chosen.
    <strong>Four colors distinguish link types</strong>: blue for ownership
    (#80b1d3), orange for partnership (#fdb462), light green for family
    relationship (#b3de69), and pink for membership (#fccde5).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Five colors represent node states</strong>: purple for entities to
    investigate (#bc80bd), light yellow for right-clickable nodes (#ffffb3),
    lime green for source-and-target nodes (#b3de69), coral for source-only
    nodes (#fb8072), and teal for target-only nodes (#8dd3c7). This color
    assignment makes <strong>node functionality immediately apparent</strong> to
    users.
</p>

<img src="palette.png" alt="Colors palette" />

<p>
    To prevent overcrowding with excessive colors,
    <strong>SVG icons differentiate entity types</strong> from
    <em>SVG Repo</em>. Icons represent unknown (?), company (building), event
    (calendar), location (pin), movement (arrows), organization (people), person
    (figure), and political organization (gavel). This iconic representation
    reduces cognitive load while maintaining visual clarity.
</p>

<img src="icons.png" alt="SVG icons for the entities types" />

<p>
    Links include <strong>directional markers</strong> indicating information
    flow. Bidirectional links display markers at both ends. When multiple link
    types exist between two nodes, they are drawn at
    <strong>calculated angles</strong> to ensure all connections remain visible
    simultaneously, preventing overlap and information loss.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Link width encoding weight</strong> proved subtle in practice, as
    the majority of weights fall between 0.8 and 1. However, the
    <strong>88 links with weights below 0.8</strong> provide valuable context.
    The decision to retain all weighted links, despite their visual similarity,
    prioritizes <em>information completeness</em> over simplified
    representation.
</p>

<img src="multilink example.png" alt="Multilink example" />

<p>
    The project adopted a <strong>"treasure hunt" approach</strong>, recognizing
    that suspicious behavior patterns were not apparent during initial data
    exploration. This led to developing
    <strong>comprehensive tools enabling effective visual inspection</strong>
    rather than presenting predetermined insights.
</p>

<p>
    Most interactions <strong>modify displayed data volume</strong>, except
    left-clicking which highlights without changing the data subset. This
    distinction helps users understand whether they are filtering data or simply
    emphasizing existing relationships. The opacity slider remains
    <u>disabled during node highlighting</u>
    to prevent conflicting visual states.
</p>

<h2>Analytical Findings</h2>

<p>
    <strong>
        Please refer to sections 6 and 7 of the report for more details
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    Analysis revealed
    <strong>entity 979893388 as a central node</strong> connected to multiple
    clusters. When filtering for partnership links,
    <strong>distinct clusters emerged</strong>, including a major cluster of
    highly-connected entities on the graph periphery. This cluster contains
    several big nodes interconnected through various relationship types.
</p>

<p>
    The entity maintains <strong>direct ownership links</strong> with
    <em>Mar del Oeste Pic</em> and <em>Ocean Fisheries Llc</em>, family
    relationships with <em>png xi Line</em>, Mar del Oeste Pic, Ocean Fisheries
    Llc, 903311212, and SeaSpray Wave SRL Solutions, and membership links with
    png xi Line, Mar del Oeste Pic, 903311212, and SeaSpray Wave SRL Solutions.
    Notably,
    <strong>partnership links do not directly connect 979893388</strong> to
    these major entities.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Entity 160 demonstrates broad ownership influence</strong> over
    major entities except Mar del Oeste Pic. It owns png xi Line, SeaSpray Wave
    SRL Solutions, and has bidirectional ownership relationships with Ocean
    Fisheries Llc and 903311212. Membership links extend from 160 to png xi Line
    and Mar del Oeste Pic.
</p>

<p>
    The
    <strong>absence of partnership and family relationship links</strong>
    connecting 160 to major entities suggests a pattern focused on
    <strong>formal ownership and membership structures</strong>. This
    ownership-centric network might indicate attempts to control multiple
    entities while maintaining distance through formal business relationships.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Mar de la Vida OJSC</em> connects to a cluster of entities primarily
    through <em>membership-type links</em>, acting as a source with targets at
    link distance 1. At link distance 2, connections through
    <em>node 33681303</em> reveal another cluster with various relationship
    types.
</p>

<p>
    Two entities directly linked to Mar de la Vida OJSC,
    <em>Ancla Azul Company Solutions</em> and <em>â**He</em>, connect to
    <strong>larger entities previously identified</strong>, specifically Mar del
    Oeste Pic and SeaSpray Wave SRL Solutions. This interconnection suggests
    <strong>potential collaboration in illegal activities</strong>, though
    direct evidence remains circumstantial.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Oceanfront Oasis Inc Carriers</em> presents a unique case with
    <strong>only incoming connections and no outgoing links</strong>. Its
    significant connection to 979893388, which owns it, places it within the
    broader network. At link distance 2, nodes like FishEye International, 2262,
    and 8787 link it to all major entities including SeaSpray Wave SRL Solutions
    and Ocean Fisheries LLC.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>lack of outgoing connections</strong> combined with ties to
    significant entities suggests it may be embedded in a network facilitating
    illegal fishing activities, potentially serving as a
    <strong>recipient or endpoint</strong> rather than an active connector.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Entity 8327</em> connects to two small clusters through membership and
    ownership links at link distance 1. At distance 2, it connects through
    <em>Calvin Salas</em>
    using partnership links to the cluster of large entities. Additionally,
    <strong>entity 160 points to 8327</strong>, providing another connection to
    the broader network.
</p>

<p>
    This layered connectivity indicates 8327 may have ties to illegal fishing
    activities, though its position suggests a
    <strong>more peripheral role</strong> compared to central entities like
    979893388 and 160.
</p>

<p>
    A
    <strong
        >significant pattern associated with potential illegal activity</strong
    >
    is the presence of <strong>clusters at link distance 1 or 2</strong> from
    investigated entities. These clusters suggest coordinated interactions that
    could indicate illicit behavior. Links between suspect entities and major
    highly-connected entities potentially imply illegal activities, though they
    may also represent legitimate business interactions.
</p>

<p>
    The findings emerged through <strong>visual exploration</strong> rather than
    prior data analysis, highlighting the importance of
    <em>interactive visualization</em> in uncovering irregularities. While
    identified patterns suggest possible illegal activity,
    <u>further investigation is necessary</u> to understand connection nature
    and reduce uncertainty.
</p>
