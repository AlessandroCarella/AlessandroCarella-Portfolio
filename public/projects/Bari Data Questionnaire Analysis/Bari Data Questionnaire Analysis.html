<p>
    I worked on the analysis of a questionnaire carried by the editorial staff
    of
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laredazionebari/">Scomodo Bari</a>. This
    project was created to support a collective writing article about
    aggregation spaces and urban social dynamics in the city of Bari. The work
    includes multiple data analysis studies conducted on survey responses from
    approximately 1,000 Bari residents.
</p>

<p>
    The project transforms questionnaire data into actionable insights through
    five distinct analytical approaches: AI-powered citizen desires, regarding
    the city of Bari, using
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/sogni/">
        natural language processing analysis</a
    >, geographic heatmap visualization of urban activity patterns both through
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/mappa/">
        classical heatmap representation</a
    >, and
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/mappa%20v2/">
        with a neighboroods split</a
    >,
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/grafici/">
        survey response categorization and visualization</a
    >, and
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/correlation/">
        statistical correlation analysis
    </a>
    of youth behavior patterns.
</p>

<p>
    By combining machine learning techniques with interactive web
    visualizations, this project makes urban data accessible and contributes to
    evidence-based cultural analysis for the city of Bari,

<h2>What I Worked on</h2>
<p>
    This project provided me with experience in full-stack data science and
    dashboard development. I learned how to implement advanced natural language
    processing techniques which i didn't study during my master course,
    specifically using
    <a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html"> BERTopic </a>
    for unsupervised topic modeling on open-ended text responses in Italian.
    This required understanding not just the technical implementation but also
    how to tune parameters for meaningful results in a civic context.
</p>

<p>
    I gained more expertise in geospatial data processing and visualization,
    learning to work with coordinate validation, and intensity calculations.
    This included understanding the balance between technical accuracy and
    user-friendly interfaces that non-technical users could navigate
    effectively.
</p>

<p>
    During the development of the project i used data preprocessing techniques
    including one-hot encoding for categorical variables and multi-label
    binarization for complex survey responses. I identified and created
    visualizations for statistical correlations in ways that reveal meaningful
    patterns without overwhelming users with complexity.

<h2>Citizen Desires Analysis</h2>

<img src="sogni.png" alt="Citizen Desires Analysis Dashboard">
<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
    The
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/sogni/">
        visualization
    </a>
    presents an AI-powered citizen engagement platform that analyzes open-ended
    survey responses from Bari residents about their vision for the city. It
    features two interactive views: a circle packing diagram and a treemap.
    Users can explore discovered topics through the interface that displays
    topic clusters, associated keywords, and allows drilling down into original
    citizen responses. The visualization provides users with an accessible way
    to understand what citizens care about most. Each topic is represented with
    proportional sizing based on frequency, and clicking on topics reveals the
    underlying text responses that contributed to each theme.
</p>

<h3>Notebook</h3>
<p>
    The
    <a
        href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/sogni/analisi%20dati/clustering"
    >
        notebook
    </a>
    implements Natural Language Processing techniques using BERTopic for
    unsupervised topic modeling on Italian text responses. It processes
    thousands of open-ended survey answers, cleaning and preprocessing the text
    data before applying transformer-based embeddings. The analysis
    automatically discovers thematic patterns in citizen responses without
    predefined categories, using dimensionality reduction and clustering
    algorithms to group similar responses. The notebook includes parameter
    tuning for optimal topic coherence, extraction of representative keywords
    for each topic, and preparation of structured data for the web
    visualization.

<h2>Geographic Heatmap</h2>

<img src="mappa.png" alt="Generated heatmap">
<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
    This
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/mappa/">
        interactive geographic heatmap platform
    </a>
    visualizes urban activity patterns across Bari neighborhoods using
    color-coded intensity zones. The interface allows users to toggle between
    satellite and standard map views, switch between different neighborhood
    boundary overlays, and adjust the heatmap radius for different levels of
    granularity. Features include smart masking to focus on specific geographic
    areas, and fractional zoom controls for precise navigation. The
    visualization uses a gradient color scheme to represent location frequency
    data, making spatial patterns immediately apparent. Users can hide or show
    the polygon overlay and neighborhood boundaries, and reset zoom to return to
    the full city view.
</p>

<h3>Notebook</h3>
<p>
    The
    <a
        href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/mappa/analisi%20dati/analisi%20spazi"
    >
        notebook
    </a>
    handles geospatial data processing including coordinate validation,
    cleaning, and intensity calculations. It processes raw location data from
    survey responses, validates geographic coordinates to ensure they fall
    within Bari's boundaries, and calculates frequency metrics for each
    location. The analysis includes spatial aggregation techniques to generate
    density measurements across the city. The notebook exports structured
    datasets in formats compatible with Leaflet.js heatmap libraries, including
    coordinate pairs, intensity values, and neighborhood classification data.
    Additional processing includes handling edge cases, removing outliers, and
    preparing GeoJSON data for neighborhood boundary overlays.

<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/mappa%20v2/">
        Another version
    </a>
    of the geographic heatmap that combines traditional heatmap visualization
    with polygon-based neighborhood analysis. This dual-layer approach allows
    users to visualize discrete neighborhood-level aggregations. The interface
    includes controls to toggle the polygon overlay, switch between neighborhood
    boundary versions, hide/show neighborhood names, and completely hide the
    heatmap layer to focus on neighborhood statistics. The visualization
    provides a more nuanced understanding of spatial patterns by showing how
    activity concentrates within specific administrative boundaries, while
    maintaining the granular detail of the continuous heatmap underneath.

<p>
    The
    <a
        href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/grafici/analisi%20dati/analisi%20generale"
    >
        notebook
    </a>
    implements a full-stack survey data processing pipeline that categorizes
    question types (categorical,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"> Likert scale </a>,
    multiple-choice, multi-select) and applies appropriate cleaning and
    transformation techniques for each. It handles missing data, standardizes
    response formats, and implements one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
    The analysis includes frequency calculations, percentage computations, and
    statistical summaries for each survey question. The notebook exports
    structured JSON files organized by question type, with metadata about
    response options, labels, and statistical measures. This preprocessing
    ensures that the web dashboard receives clean, well-structured data
    optimized for D3.js visualization libraries.

<h2>Correlation Analysis</h2>

<h3>Visualization</h3>
<p>
    A
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/correlation/">
        statistical visualization tool
    </a>
    that presents correlation matrices as interactive, color-coded heatmaps. The
    interface displays relationships between various demographic, behavioral,
    and attitudinal variables from the youth survey data. Users can customize
    the color palette to highlight different correlation strengths, hover over
    cells to view exact correlation coefficients and statistical significance
    indicators, and export the visualization as PNG files for presentations. The
    heatmap uses color intensity to represent correlation strength, with
    different hues for positive and negative correlations. The visualization
    helps researchers and decision-makers quickly identify meaningful patterns
    and relationships in the survey data.

    implements data preprocessing techniques including one-hot encoding for
    categorical variables, multi-label binarization for questions where
    respondents could select multiple options, and proper handling of ordinal
    Likert scale data. It computes correlation matrices using appropriate
    methods (Pearson, Spearman, or Point-Biserial) based on variable types. The
    analysis identifies statistically significant correlations, filters out weak
    or non-significant relationships, and structures the results for
    visualization. The notebook includes detailed documentation of preprocessing
    decisions, handles edge cases like sparse variables, and generates JSON
    output containing the correlation matrix, variable labels, and metadata
    about statistical significance. This enables the web interface to display
    clear, scientifically rigorous correlation insights.
