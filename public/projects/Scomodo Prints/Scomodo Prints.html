<p>
    I have developed a digital toolkit for urban research and analysis in my
    hometown, Bari. The project is part of a collaborative article examining
    aggregation spaces and urban dynamics, this project contains two
    sophisticated web-based visualization tools designed to transform survey
    data and geographic information into publication-ready outputs. The tools
    were developed for
    <a href="https://scomodo.org/"> Scomodo </a>, a cultural association focused
    on independent journalism and social analysis.
</p>

<p>
    The project addresses a critical need in urban research: the ability to
    visualize and communicate complex data about community spaces, amenities,
    and resident perspectives in an accessible yet rigorous manner. By combining
    interactive data visualization with cartographic mapping, the toolkit
    enables researchers, journalists, and community organizers to explore
    patterns in urban life, identify spatial relationships, and produce
    high-quality visual materials for both digital and print publications.
</p>
<p>
    The project consists of two tools: an interactive survey visualization
    dashboard that transforms some of
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/"> this </a>
    questionnaire responses into dynamic charts and graphs, and a cartographic
    mapping tool that creates publication-ready SVG maps displaying various
    urban features and amenities.
</p>

<p>
    The maps generated using the tool were were featured at a
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQHu5DvDBKF/"> festival </a>
    organized by the association in October 2025 (see pictures below).
</p>

<p>
    Both tools were built with a focus on accessibility, usability, and
    professional-grade output quality, ensuring that the resulting
    visualizations could serve both analytical and communicative purposes in the
    context of urban research and journalism.
</p>

    A live version of both project is aviable at this

<h2>Design and User Experience</h2>
<p>
    Live preview functionality is central to the user experience of both tools.
    In the survey dashboard, every change to chart type, color scheme, or data
    selection instantly updates the visualization, allowing users to explore
    different representations interactively. This feedback loop supports an
    exploratory approach to data analysis, where users can quickly test
    different hypotheses and visual approaches without committing to any single
    representation options.
</p>

<p>
    The cartographic tool implements a synchronized dual-view system: a live map
    preview for interaction and data verification, paired with an export preview
    that shows exactly how the final SVG will appear. This eliminates surprises
    during the export process and allows users to make adjustments with full
    knowledge of how they will affect the final output. The SVG files produced
    by the interface later went through some improvements of the designers at
    Scomodo, you can see the final results in the gallery.
</p>

<p>
    Responsive design considerations ensure that both tools function effectively
    across different screen sizes, though the focus remains on desktop use where
    the complexity of the controls and the need for precision make
    mouse-and-keyboard interaction optimal. The layout adapts gracefully to
    different viewport sizes, maintaining usability even on smaller laptop
    screens while taking full advantage of larger displays when available.
</p>

<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
<p>
    One of the primary challenges was achieving publication-quality SVG exports
    that could be used directly in professional design workflows. Initial export
    implementations produced SVG files that did not represent the correct
    output. Sometimes text would reflow unpredictably, fonts would substitute
    incorrectly, and complex chart elements would become uneditable. The
    solution required embedding fonts directly in the SVG files using
    base64-encoded data URLs and implementing path generation that maintains
    editability while ensuring visual fidelity.
</p>

<p>
    The cartographic tool faced the technical challenge of working with map
    tiles across CORS restrictions. Modern browsers prevent loading tiles from
    many mapping services when running locally or from different domains, which
    would break the export functionality. The solution implemented a proxy
    mechanism combined with tile caching strategies that respect both security
    constraints and the need to generate high-quality map exports. This required
    careful handling of asynchronous operations to ensure all tiles loaded
    before export generation began.
</p>

<p>
    Label collision detection and resolution required developing custom
    algorithms since standard mapping libraries don't provide adequate solutions
    for publication-quality label placement. The system needed to balance
    multiple factors: maintaining geographic accuracy, ensuring readability, and
    creating visually pleasing layouts. The implemented solution uses a
    combination of quadtree spatial indexing for efficient collision detection
    and iterative adjustment algorithms that nudge labels to optimal positions
    while respecting proximity to their associated markers.
