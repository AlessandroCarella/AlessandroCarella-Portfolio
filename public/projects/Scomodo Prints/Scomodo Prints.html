<p>
    I have developed a
    <strong>digital toolkit for urban research and analysis</strong> in my
    hometown, Bari. The project is part of a collaborative article examining
    aggregation spaces and urban dynamics, this project contains
    <strong>two sophisticated web-based visualization tools</strong> designed to
    transform survey data and geographic information into
    <strong>publication-ready outputs</strong>. The tools were developed for
    <a href="https://scomodo.org/"> Scomodo </a>, a
    <em>cultural association</em> focused on independent journalism and social
    analysis.
</p>

<p>
    The project addresses a <strong>critical need in urban research</strong>:
    the ability to visualize and communicate complex data about community
    spaces, amenities, and resident perspectives in an
    <em>accessible yet rigorous</em> manner. By combining
    <strong>interactive data visualization with cartographic mapping</strong>,
    the toolkit enables researchers, journalists, and community organizers to
    explore patterns in urban life, identify spatial relationships, and produce
    high-quality visual materials for both digital and print publications.
</p>
<p>
    The project consists of <strong>two tools</strong>: an
    <strong>interactive survey visualization dashboard</strong> that transforms
    some of
    <a href="https://bari-data-questionnaire-analysis.pages.dev/"> this </a>
    questionnaire responses into dynamic charts and graphs, and a
    <strong>cartographic mapping tool</strong> that creates
    <em>publication-ready SVG maps</em> displaying various urban features and
    amenities.
</p>

<p>
    The maps generated using the tool were were

    organized by the association in <em>October 2025</em> (see pictures below).
</p>

<p>
    Both tools were built with a focus on
    <strong
        >accessibility, usability, and professional-grade output quality</strong
    >, ensuring that the resulting visualizations could serve both analytical
    and communicative purposes in the context of urban research and journalism.
</p>

    A live version of both project is aviable at this

<h2>Design and User Experience</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Live preview functionality</strong> is central to the user
    experience of both tools. In the survey dashboard, every change to chart
    type, color scheme, or data selection
    <strong>instantly updates the visualization</strong>, allowing users to
    explore different representations interactively. This
    <em>feedback loop</em> supports an exploratory approach to data analysis,
    where users can quickly test different hypotheses and visual approaches
    without committing to any single representation options.
</p>

<p>
    The cartographic tool implements a
    <strong>synchronized dual-view system</strong>: a live map preview for
    interaction and data verification, paired with an
    <strong>export preview</strong> that shows exactly how the final SVG will
    appear. This eliminates surprises during the export process and allows users
    to make adjustments with full knowledge of how they will affect the final
    output. The <em>SVG files</em> produced by the interface later went through
    some improvements of the designers at Scomodo, you can see the final results
    in the gallery.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Responsive design considerations</strong> ensure that both tools
    function effectively across different screen sizes, though the focus remains
    on <em>desktop use</em> where the complexity of the controls and the need
    for precision make mouse-and-keyboard interaction optimal. The layout adapts
    gracefully to different viewport sizes, maintaining usability even on
    smaller laptop screens while taking full advantage of larger displays when
    available.
</p>

<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
<p>
    One of the primary challenges was achieving
    <strong>publication-quality SVG exports</strong> that could be used directly
    in professional design workflows. Initial export implementations produced
    SVG files that did not represent the correct output. Sometimes text would
    reflow unpredictably, fonts would substitute incorrectly, and complex chart
    elements would become uneditable. The solution required
    <strong>embedding fonts directly in the SVG files</strong> using
    <em>base64-encoded data URLs</em> and implementing path generation that
    maintains editability while ensuring visual fidelity.
</p>

<p>
    The cartographic tool faced the technical challenge of working with
    <strong>map tiles across CORS restrictions</strong>. Modern browsers prevent
    loading tiles from many mapping services when running locally or from
    different domains, which would break the export functionality. The solution
    implemented a
    <strong>proxy mechanism combined with tile caching strategies</strong> that
    respect both security constraints and the need to generate high-quality map
    exports. This required careful handling of
    <em>asynchronous operations</em> to ensure all tiles loaded before export
    generation began.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Label collision detection and resolution</strong> required
    developing custom algorithms since standard mapping libraries don't provide
    adequate solutions for publication-quality label placement. The system
    needed to balance multiple factors: maintaining geographic accuracy,
    ensuring readability, and creating visually pleasing layouts. The
    implemented solution uses a combination of
    <em>quadtree spatial indexing</em> for efficient collision detection and
    <strong>iterative adjustment algorithms</strong> that nudge labels to
    optimal positions while respecting proximity to their associated markers.
