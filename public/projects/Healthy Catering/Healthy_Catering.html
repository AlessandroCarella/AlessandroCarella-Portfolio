<p>
    <strong>Healthy Catering</strong> is a
    <strong>3D serious game</strong> developed as part of my bachelor's degree
    in Computer Science at the <em>University of Bari</em>. Created in
    collaboration with
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/f-cassano/"> Saverio Cassano </a>
    , this project combines gaming entertainment with
    <strong
        >educational content focused on nutrition, pathologies, and
        environmental sustainability</strong
    >. The game places players in the role of a restaurant manager who must
    serve appropriate dishes to customers based on their medical conditions and
    dietary requirements.
</p>

<p>
    Developed for the <em>Multimedia Design and Production</em> course, the game
    targets students from
    <strong>hospitality institutes and nutrition science courses</strong>. The
    project emphasizes the correlation between food choices, health conditions,
    and environmental impact through an engaging
    <strong>first-person gameplay experience</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The game was later extended with <strong>VR capabilities</strong> by my
    collaborator as part of his bachelor thesis. The current version with VR
    support is available at this
    <a href="https://github.com/AlessandroCarella/Healthy-Catering-Alessandro"
        >project repository</a
    >, though this page focuses on the <strong>original PC version</strong> I
    contributed to. You can also find

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
    This project provided me with experience in
    <strong>game development</strong> and
    <strong>interdisciplinary collaboration</strong>. Working with
    <em>Unity</em> and <em>C#</em> deepened my understanding of game engine
    architecture, 3D graphics programming, and real-time interactive systems. I
    learned how to implement game mechanics involving inventory management,
    scoring systems, and dynamic UI elements that respond to player choices.
</p>

<p>
    The serious game nature of the project taught me how to
    <strong>balance educational content with engaging gameplay</strong>. I
    discovered the importance of progressive difficulty curves, clear feedback
    mechanisms, and intuitive tutorials. Designing systems that teach players
    about
    <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutri-score">
        <em>nutriScore</em>
    </a>
    , <em>costoEco</em> (environmental cost), and pathology-diet relationships
    required careful consideration of how information is presented and
    reinforced through gameplay.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Project management skills</strong> were essential throughout the
    development. I learned to estimate time requirements accurately, track
    progress across multiple development phases, and adapt to changing
    requirements. The structured approach using flowcharts, storyboards, and
    prototypes proved crucial for maintaining alignment between design vision
    and implementation.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>User testing</strong> opened my eyes to the gap between developer
    intention and player experience. Conducting alpha and beta tests, observing
    player behavior, and gathering feedback through
    <em>SUS (System Usability Scale)</em> questionnaires taught me the value of
    <strong>iterative design</strong>. The testing phase revealed issues we
    hadn't anticipated, such as difficulty balancing problems that required
    adjusting score thresholds to prevent player frustration.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Collaboration</strong> was central to the project's success. Working
    closely with another developer, coordinating with external contributors for
    music, 3D assets, and UI design taught me effective communication and
    improved my skills at <strong>version control practices using Git</strong>.
    I learned to divide responsibilities, integrate work from multiple sources,
    and maintain code quality across team contributions.
</p>

<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>

<p>
    The game was built using <strong>Unity 2021.3.5f</strong> with
    <strong>C#</strong> as the primary programming language.
    <em>Visual Studio 2019</em> served as the development environment, providing
    robust debugging and code completion capabilities. For asset creation and
    editing, we utilized <em>Adobe Photoshop 2022</em> for textures and UI
    elements, <em>Adobe Illustrator 2022</em> for vector graphics and logos, and
    <em>Blender</em>
    for custom 3D modeling when needed.
</p>

<p>
    The project leveraged several <strong>Unity asset packs</strong> including
    <a
        href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/polygon-city-pack-art-by-synty-95214"
    >
        Polygon City
    </a>
    ,
    <a
        href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/polygon-farm-pack-art-by-synty-146192"
    >
        Polygon Farmer
    </a>
    , and
    <a
        href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/polygon-prototype-pack-art-by-synty-137126"
    >
        Polygon Prototype
    </a>
    Pack for environmental 3D models. Character animations were sourced from
    <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/"> <em>Mixamo</em> </a>
    , while the soundtrack was custom-composed by
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-congedo7/"> Alessandro Congedo </a>
    . Version control was managed through <em>GitHub</em>, enabling asynchronous
    development and collaborative workflows.
</p>

<p>
    The game's architecture revolves around several interconnected systems. The
    <strong>customer interaction system</strong> manages client profiles,
    including their pathologies (diabetes, hypertension), dietary restrictions,
    and dish preferences. Each customer is generated with specific health
    parameters that determine which dishes are suitable for them.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>scoring algorithm</strong> evaluates dish selections based on
    multiple factors: affinity with customer pathologies and diet,
    <em>nutriScore</em> ratings (A through E), and <em>costoEco</em> values
    (environmental impact from 0-41+). The calculation awards
    <strong>base points of 100</strong> for appropriate dishes or
    <strong>-10 for poor choices</strong>, then applies percentage-based bonuses
    or penalties based on nutritional quality and environmental sustainability.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>inventory management system</strong> tracks ingredient
    quantities and enforces constraints on dish preparation. Players can only
    prepare dishes when all required ingredients are available in sufficient
    quantities. The shop system allows purchasing new ingredients using earned
    money, creating a <strong>resource management loop</strong> that encourages
    strategic planning.
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>dynamic price calculation system</strong> determines earnings per
    dish served. The formula considers ingredient base costs plus a 10% profit
    margin, then applies affinity bonuses (+5% for correct choices, -5% for
    incorrect ones) and ranking bonuses (3%, 2%, or 1% for dishes in the top
    three positions of the sorted dish list).
</p>

<p>
    The UI employs a consistent visual language using the
    <em>Roboto-Bold Sans Serif</em> font for clarity and readability. A
    <strong>color-coding system</strong> helps players quickly identify
    information categories:
    <strong>green for correct choices, red for incorrect ones</strong>, yellow
    for ingredients, orange for dishes, blue for pathologies, and purple for
    diets.
</p>

<p>
    The in-game interface includes multiple views: a
    <strong>customer interaction menu</strong> displaying medical records and
    dish options, an <strong>inventory management system</strong> accessed
    through a virtual computer, a <strong>shop interface</strong> for purchasing
    ingredients, and a <strong>recipe book</strong> showing all available dishes
    with their ingredients and technical specifications. An integrated help menu
    provides contextual guidance accessible at any time by
    <u>pressing the H key</u>.
</p>

<h2>Game Design & Mechanics</h2>

<p>
    Players assume the role of a <strong>restaurant manager</strong> who has
    inherited their uncle's establishment. The
    <strong>core gameplay loop</strong> involves serving customers by selecting
    appropriate dishes from available options, earning money and points based on
    choice quality, managing ingredient inventory, purchasing supplies from the
    shop, and progressing through increasingly challenging levels.
</p>

<p>
    The game features <strong>three levels with escalating difficulty</strong>.
    <strong>Level 0</strong> serves as an interactive tutorial introducing
    movement controls, customer interaction mechanics, inventory management, and
    the shop system. This level requires serving 5 customers and achieving a
    score of 700. <strong>Level 1</strong> focuses on diabetes-related dietary
    knowledge, requiring 15 customers served and a score of 1400.
    <strong>Level 2</strong> addresses hypertension, demanding 20 customers
    served and a score of 2000.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>educational content is seamlessly integrated</strong> into
    gameplay rather than presented as separate lessons. Players learn about
    pathology-appropriate nutrition by making decisions and receiving
    <strong>immediate feedback</strong>. Incorrect dish selections trigger
    informative pop-ups explaining why specific ingredients are incompatible
    with certain conditions or diets.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>NPC characters</strong> scattered throughout the game world provide
    contextual tips about dish selection, <em>nutriScore</em> interpretation,
    and environmental considerations. The recipe book serves as an in-game
    reference, allowing players to research dish compositions, nutritional
    ratings, and environmental impacts without breaking immersion.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>tutorial system</strong> employs a gradual reveal approach,
    introducing concepts only when necessary to avoid overwhelming players with
    information. Each tutorial segment combines textual explanations with video
    demonstrations and
    <u>requires players to successfully complete the action before proceeding</u
    >, ensuring active learning rather than passive reading.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Difficulty increases</strong> through multiple mechanisms: higher
    score requirements, more customers to serve, stricter failure thresholds,
    and more complex pathology-diet combinations. The game maintains tension
    through <strong>resource scarcity</strong>, players must balance immediate
    food service needs with long-term inventory investment decisions.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Failure conditions</strong> include
    <u>running out of both ingredients and money</u> (below 5 currency units),
    or failing to reach the level's score threshold within the maximum number of
    customer servings (10 for Level 0, 25 for Level 1, 30 for Level 2). This
    creates strategic pressure to make optimal choices rather than merely
    acceptable ones.
</p>

<h2>Development Process</h2>

<p>
    The project began with
    <strong>comprehensive planning documentation</strong> including requirement
    specifications, target audience analysis, and style guidelines. We defined
    minimum and recommended system requirements, ensuring the game would be
    accessible on modest hardware (minimum 1GB RAM, integrated graphics) while
    supporting high-end configurations (up to 1920x1080 resolution,
    <em>GEFORCE GT</em> graphics cards).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Design documentation</strong> included detailed flowcharts mapping
    navigation between all game screens and gameplay states, storyboards
    specifying visual layout and color schemes for each interface, and
    prototypes demonstrating key interactions. This upfront design work proved
    crucial for maintaining consistency and coordination between developers.
</p>

<p>
    Development followed a <strong>phased approach</strong> tracked through
    weekly progress monitoring. The schedule allocated time for content
    acquisition (5 hours), material verification and validation (5 hours),
    interface definition (17 hours), material refinement (8 hours),
    <strong>core development (48 hours)</strong>,
    <strong>testing (30 hours)</strong>, and publication (2 hours).
</p>

<p>
    Actual development tracking revealed the
    <strong>fluid nature of game development</strong>. Early weeks saw
    concentrated effort on asset acquisition, interface design, and material
    refinement, with development intensity increasing mid-project. The final
    weeks focused exclusively on testing and bug fixing before publication.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>project team</strong> consisted of two primary developers with
    support from external contributors. <em>Alessandro Congedo</em> composed the
    original soundtrack, <em>Francesca Caranzano</em> assisted with UI design,
    <em>Angelica Garofalo</em> contributed 3D art assets, and
    <em>Vincenzo Francesco Pio Grande</em> provided text review and editing.
</p>

<p>
    Technical resources combined owned assets (<em>Polygon packs</em>), free
    Unity Asset Store resources, online sound effect repositories, and
    custom-created materials. This hybrid approach balanced
    <strong>quality requirements with the zero-budget constraint</strong>
    imposed by the academic context.
</p>

<h2>Testing & Results</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Alpha testing</strong> focused on functional correctness, structural
    integrity, and performance across different hardware configurations. We
    evaluated interface pleasantness, simplicity, command learning curve,
    response accuracy, and feature functionality. Testing was conducted on four
    machines ranging from modest (<em>i5-4690K with GTX 1650 Super</em>) to
    high-end (<em>Ryzen 7 5800H with RTX 3060</em>) configurations.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Key issues discovered</strong> during alpha testing included
    <strong>framerate-dependent animation timing</strong> that caused
    inconsistent behavior across different PCs, and
    <strong>persistent game state variables</strong> that weren't being reset
    when levels were reloaded. The animation issue was resolved by implementing
    framerate-independent timing, while the state issue required explicit
    variable reinitialization on level load.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Performance testing</strong> showed stable frame rates across all
    test configurations, with CPU usage ranging from 27-50% and GPU usage from
    20-62% depending on hardware. Even the lowest-spec machine maintained stable
    performance at maximum graphics settings, validating our optimization
    efforts.
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>critical discovery</strong> during alpha testing was
    <strong>difficulty balancing</strong>. Initial testing revealed that
    achieving level objectives required perfect performance with no margin for
    error. This created excessive challenge and potential player frustration. We
    responded by <u>lowering score thresholds for each level</u>, providing a
    more reasonable error margin while maintaining meaningful challenge.
</p>

<p>
    Navigation consistency checks revealed
    <strong>missing confirmation dialogs</strong> when players attempted to
    return to the main menu mid-level, potentially causing accidental progress
    loss. Audio system testing uncovered rare cases where footstep sounds would
    continue playing when menus opened, requiring explicit audio suppression
    during menu states.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Beta testing</strong> involved five users representing both target
    users (students from relevant educational backgrounds) and experienced
    gamers who could provide technical feedback. Testing occurred in controlled
    environments with developers present for observation and note-taking.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>System Usability Scale (SUS)</em> questionnaire yielded a
    <strong>final score of 91.5 out of 100</strong>, indicating
    <strong>excellent usability</strong>. Individual responses showed
    consistency across metrics, with particularly strong scores for feature
    integration, ease of learning, and minimal need for external support. Users
    rated the game as simple to use (scores of 3-4 out of 4) and felt
    comfortable during play.
</p>

<p>
    Qualitative feedback from beta testers highlighted the game's
    <strong>intuitive controls and clear visual communication</strong>. The
    color-coding system for information categories received positive mention,
    helping players quickly parse complex nutritional data. The tutorial
    system's gradual introduction of concepts was praised for preventing
    information overload.
</p>

<p>
    Some users initially found the
    <strong>scoring system's complexity challenging</strong> to understand,
    particularly the interaction between <em>nutriScore</em>, <em>costoEco</em>,
    and pathology affinity bonuses. This feedback validated our decision to
    include detailed help documentation accessible at any time during gameplay,
    and suggested the tutorial could spend additional time on scoring mechanics.
</p>

<p>
    The completed project
    <strong>successfully met its educational objectives</strong> while
    maintaining engaging gameplay. The game runs stably across a wide range of
    hardware configurations, features an
    <strong>intuitive interface validated by SUS testing</strong>, and
    effectively teaches players about nutrition-pathology relationships and
    environmental food impacts. The structured development approach,
    comprehensive testing, and willingness to iterate based on feedback resulted
    in a <strong>polished final product</strong> that serves its serious game
    purpose effectively.
