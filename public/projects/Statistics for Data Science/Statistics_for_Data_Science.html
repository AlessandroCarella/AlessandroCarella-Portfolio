    This project is a <strong>recreation and implementation</strong> of the
    research paper
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06710">
        "Word Embeddings as Statistical Estimators"
    </a>
    by
    <em>Neil Dey, Matthew Singer, Jonathan P. Williams, and Srijan Sengupta</em>
    from North Carolina State University, published on arXiv in January 2023.
    The goal was to
    <strong
        >reproduce the theoretical framework and experimental results</strong
    >
    presented in the original paper, gaining hands-on understanding of the
    statistical foundations underlying word embedding methods.
</p>
<p>
    The original paper investigates
    <strong>word embeddings through a statistical lens</strong>. Word embeddings
    are fundamental tools in NLP that
    <strong>map words and phrases to vectors</strong> in Euclidean space,
    enabling the application of mathematical and machine learning methods to
    text data. However, these embeddings have historically been evaluated
    primarily through downstream task performance,
    <strong>lacking formal theoretical understanding</strong> of what linguistic
    features they actually capture.
</p>
<p>
    The core research question addresses whether
    <strong>word embeddings, particularly Word2Vec</strong>, can be formally
    defined and analyzed using statistical frameworks. Rather than treating
    embeddings as black boxes evaluated solely on performance metrics, the paper
    proposes
    <strong>defining them in statistically meaningful ways</strong> using
    generative models with known features. Our recreation involved implementing
    the proposed algorithms, generating synthetic corpora using
    <em>copula-based models</em>, and validating that embedding methods can
    consistently recover known features from text data.
</p>
<p>
    By recreating this work, we implemented the
    <strong
        >theoretical connection between Skip-gram and Pointwise Mutual
        Information</strong
    >
    matrices, developed the novel <em>SVD-based estimators</em> including
    <em>EM-MVSVD and DD-MVSVD</em> for handling infinite PMI values which was
    proposed in the paper, and
    <strong>replicated the experimental validation</strong> using the Brown
    Corpus.
</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
    Through recreating this research paper, I gained insights into both the
    theoretical foundations and practical implementation challenges of
    statistical NLP. The most significant learning was understanding how
    <strong>Word2Vec implicitly performs matrix factorization</strong> on
    <em>Pointwise Mutual Information matrices</em>. Implementing this connection
    from scratch, building on <em>Levy and Goldberg's 2014 work</em>,
    transformed my perspective on embeddings from
    <strong
        >opaque neural methods to interpretable statistical estimators</strong
    >.
</p>
<p>
    Reproducing the <strong>copula-based text generation model</strong> taught
    me how to work with challenging statistical concepts including
    <a href="https://bggj.is/posts/gaussian-copula/">
        <em>Gaussian copulas</em>
    </a>
    combined with <em>Zipfian marginal distributions</em>. Understanding
    <a
        href="https://www.finance-tutoring.fr/understanding-sklar's-theorem-in-layman%E2%80%99s-terms%E2%80%A6/"
    >
        <em>Sklar's Theorem</em>
    </a>
    and implementing the code to
    <strong>combine marginal distributions into joint distributions</strong> was
    crucial for building the dense corpus generation model. This hands-on
    experience showed me how theoretical statistics can be applied to create
    practical models that reflect real-world linguistic phenomena like
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law"><em>Zipf's law</em></a
    >.
</p>
<p>
    The recreation deepened my understanding of
    <strong>missing data problems</strong> in statistics through direct
    implementation. <u>Not all missing values are created equal</u>, the
    distinction between <strong>sparse settings</strong> where zeros represent
    true absence versus <strong>dense settings</strong> where zeros result from
    finite sampling has
    <strong>profound implications for algorithm design</strong>. Implementing
    the <em>EM-MVSVD and DD-MVSVD algorithms</em> from the paper's pseudocode
    gave me practical experience on statistical methods code implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Working through the
    <strong>Expectation-Maximization algorithm implementation</strong> in the
    context of Singular Value Decomposition taught me how
    <strong
        >iterative optimization methods can handle complex matrix completion
        problems</strong
    >. I learned to implement <em>exponential smoothing</em> for convergence
    stabilization and understood the importance of proper initialization in
    iterative algorithms. Comparing my implementation results with the paper's
    figures <strong>validated my understanding</strong> and revealed subtleties
    in the algorithms that were not immediately apparent from the mathematical
    descriptions alone.
</p>
<p>
    Replicating the experimental phase taught me
    <strong>rigorous methodology for comparing statistical estimators</strong>.
    I learned to generate controlled synthetic datasets where
    <strong>ground truth is known</strong>, enabling direct evaluation of method
    accuracy through <em>RMSE measurements</em>. Successfully reproducing the
    paper's key finding, that
    <strong
        >truncated SVD on SPPMI degrades with more data while MVSVD methods
        remain consistent</strong
    >, demonstrated the value of statistically principled approaches and
    validated my implementation.
</p>

<h2>Theoretical Foundation</h2>
<p>
    The theoretical foundation rests on establishing the
    <strong>connection between Word2Vec and Pointwise Mutual Information</strong
    >. The <em>Skip-gram objective</em> with negative sampling
    <strong>implicitly factorizes a shifted PMI matrix</strong>. Specifically,
    Word2Vec with <em>k negative samples</em> factorizes
    <strong>SPMI = PMI - log(k)·J</strong>, where J is the all-ones matrix. This
    insight transformed embeddings from mysterious neural networks into
    <strong>interpretable statistical quantities</strong> measuring word
    co-occurrence patterns.
</p>
<p>
    The project addresses a fundamental challenge in real text corpora:
    <strong>infinite PMI values</strong> arising from word pairs that never
    co-occur. This necessitates
    <strong>distinguishing between two statistical settings</strong>. In the
    <strong>sparse setting</strong>, some word pairs genuinely have zero
    probability of co-occurrence, and infinite PMI represents a real absence of
    semantic relationship. In the <strong>dense setting</strong>, all word pairs
    have non-zero co-occurrence probability, and observed zeros result merely
    from <strong>finite sample sizes</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    To model language statistically, the project employs a
    <strong>first-order</strong>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">
        <em>Markov chain</em>
    </a>
    with <strong>Zipfian marginal distributions</strong> and full co-occurrence
    structure specified through <em>copulas</em>. <em>Zipf's law</em>, which
    describes the power-law distribution of word frequencies in natural
    language, is <strong>empirically verified against the Brown Corpus</strong>.
    The model incorporates this linguistic scenario by fitting Zipfian
    distributions to word frequency data and using <em>Gaussian copulas</em> to
    capture dependency structure between words.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Sklar's Theorem</em> provides the mathematical foundation for
    <strong
        >combining marginal distributions into multivariate
        distributions</strong
    >
    through copulas. This allows separating the problem into modeling individual
    word frequencies and modeling their co-occurrence relationships. The
    <strong>Gaussian copula choice</strong> is empirically motivated, it
    <strong>fits real corpus data well</strong> while remaining mathematically
    tractable for computation and analysis.
</p>

<h2>Experimental Results and Reproduction Validation</h2>
<p>
    Our recreation began by confirming that
    <strong
        >word frequencies in the Brown Corpus follow Zipfian
        distributions</strong
    >, as described in the original paper. Plotting observed frequencies against
    rank on log-log scales revealed the characteristic
    <em>power-law behavior</em>, with
    <strong>fitted curves closely matching empirical data</strong>. This
    validation justified using Zipfian marginals in the statistical text
    generation model and provided confidence that our implementation of the
    copula-based synthetic corpus generation was correct.
</p>
<img src="zipf_fit_r.png" alt="Zipfian distributions on the Brown Corpus" />
<p>
    The primary results successfully reproduced the patterns reported in the
    paper for how
    <strong>different methods approximate population SPMI</strong> across corpus
    sizes ranging from 10 to 1,000,000 tokens. Our implementation confirmed that
    <strong
        >Word2Vec, EM-MVSVD, and DD-MVSVD all maintain consistently low
        RMSE</strong
    >
    values regardless of corpus size, with errors remaining near zero across the
    entire range. This stability indicates these methods
    <strong>successfully recover underlying semantic structure</strong> even
    from relatively small samples.
</p>
<img src="aggregated_no_sppmi.png" alt="Results without SPPMI" />
<p>
    We successfully replicated the paper's key finding:
    <strong
        >truncated SVD on SPPMI matrices exhibits dramatically different
        behavior</strong
    >
    from the other methods. Our results showed
    <strong>RMSE starting at moderate levels</strong>, for small corpora, but
    <strong>increasings systematically with corpus size</strong>, reaching values exceeding
    400 for million-token corpora. This
    <u>counterintuitive degradation</u> occurs because larger corpora reveal
    more word pairs with observed zero co-occurrence, creating more negative PMI
    entries that truncation discards,
    <strong>progressively losing more information</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>convergence between Word2Vec and MVSVD methods</strong> in our
    reproduction provides validation of both the original paper's theoretical
    framework and our implementation. The matching results confirm that
    <strong>Word2Vec implicitly factorizes SPMI matrices</strong> and that the
    MVSVD methods provide
    <strong>statistically tractable alternatives</strong> with comparable
    estimation accuracy.
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
    Recreating this research established for us the importance of
    <strong>viewing word embeddings as formal statistical estimators</strong>
    rather than purely algorithmic constructs. By implementing the framework
    that defines embeddings as
    <strong>low-rank approximations to population SPMI matrices</strong>, we
    gained appreciation for how this formalization
    <strong>enables rigorous analysis</strong> of embedding properties,
    bias-variance tradeoffs, convergence rates, and consistency, questions that
    would be unanswerable without statistical frameworks.
</p>
<p>
    The reproduction helped us understand the
    <strong
        >crucial distinction between sparse and dense statistical
        settings</strong
    >. If language truly inhabits a sparse setting where many word pairs cannot
    co-occur,
    <u
        >methods should preserve and interpret infinite PMI values as meaningful
        semantic signals</u
    >. Conversely, if language is dense with sampling zeros, methods like
    <em>DD-MVSVD</em> that
    <strong>impute missing values using distributional knowledge</strong> become
    essential. This nuanced understanding came from implementing both
    perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    Successfully reproducing the
    <strong>degradation of SPPMI with increasing data</strong> challenged our
    initial intuitions that more data always improves estimates. This finding
    from the paper, which we confirmed through our own implementation,
    demonstrates that
    <strong
        >theoretically sound methods matter more than data quantity
        alone</strong
    >. <u>Simple approaches that discard information</u>, even for seemingly
    pragmatic reasons like avoiding infinities,
    <strong>can fail in the large-data regime</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    From a practical perspective, we learned that the
    <strong>MVSVD methods offer interpretable alternatives to Word2Vec</strong>
    with similar performance but
    <strong>greater theoretical transparency</strong>. Understanding exactly
    what these methods estimate helped us reason about when they should work
    well. The methods' probabilistic foundations also suggest potential for
    <em>uncertainty quantification, Bayesian extensions</em>, and integration
    with other probabilistic NLP models.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>copula-based text generation model</strong> we implemented
    provides a valuable tool for NLP evaluation. Generating
    <strong>synthetic text with known ground truth semantic structure</strong>
    enables testing whether methods capture intended properties rather than
    merely performing well on arbitrary tasks. This
    <strong>controlled evaluation paradigm</strong> could extend beyond
    embeddings to other NLP components.
</p>
<p>
    This recreation project reinforced the
    <strong>value of reproducing research as a learning methodology</strong>.
    The process of translating mathematical descriptions into working code
    revealed <strong>implementation details and edge cases</strong> that were
    not apparent from reading the paper alone. We also gained appreciation for
    the original authors' contributions and the
    <strong>rigor required to produce reproducible research</strong> in
    statistical NLP.
